 a git file for the project

This Markdown file describes the data structure and organization for the project.
we will also elaborate about the pre project data cleaning
this data is a addition of WHR(world happiness reports) from 2011 to 2024.
the data cleaning included fixing the country names(where the standard of naming was changed in between the reports),erasing countries that dont exist and deleting duplicates.we also changed the column names(not all of the column names were identical in all the reports.)
